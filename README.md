# 🚀 Overview
polyagents is a console-based multi-agent system designed using OpenAI’s Agents SDK. The architecture allows multiple specialized agents to interact and solve complex tasks by leveraging communication and handoff mechanisms.
Each agent is built with a focused responsibility, promoting scalability and modularity.

### 🧠 About the Project
This system is designed to simulate a real-world support environment using a multi-agent approach. It includes:

🗣️ Translator Agent:
Converts text from one language to another using AI-powered translation.

🧰 Tool Agent:
Equipped with utilities (e.g., calculator, web search) to perform tool-based queries.

📚 Context Agent:
Maintains conversation context and provides relevant memory recall.

🤝 Handoff Agent (Triage):
Acts as a controller to delegate tasks to appropriate agents based on the user query.

### ✨ Creator
This entire project was independently created and developed by Muzna Amir as a demonstration of understanding and applying the OpenAI Agents SDK with a modular agent design.
